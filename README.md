# python-web-scraping
A simple python utility function that uses BeautifulSoup to scrape a html page and find out the most frequently appearing words in the page
It takes the url of the page as the parameter. In the example I've used 'Moby Dick or The Whale' book's example. You can give it any url of your choice.
